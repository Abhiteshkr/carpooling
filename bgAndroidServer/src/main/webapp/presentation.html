<h1> Carpool Presentation </h1>
<h2>Car pooling:travel, save money and help the planet! </h2>
With Android, carpooling will be easier:
<ul>
<li>location using GPS</li>
<li>communication using Google Talk</li>
<li>visualization using Google Map</li>
</ul>
And all inside one single sexy java application!
<br/>
Carpooling with Android assists both pedestrians and drivers to locate, and contact each other, increasing travel options, decreasing travel costs, and opening an accessible carpooling system to general users.
<br/>
As a real time system, Carpooling with Android could be a future mass transportation system for the general public, reducing traffic congestion and enabling every car to act as a taxi.
<br/>
With Google's assistance, Android will change the concept of people transportation and will be of great benefit in both developing and developed countries.

<h2>Why do i want to win this Challenge ?</h2>

I enjoy trying, testing and learning new technologies. I am always
looking to improve my skills.
<p/>
I have travelled extensively by hitchhiking . Hitchhiking has allowed me to meet many new and interesting people. I have dreamt of having such a tool as Carpooling with Android, to avoid having to spend hours waiting for cars.
It is my wish for such new technologies to change the world
